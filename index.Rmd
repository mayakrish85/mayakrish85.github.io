## About Me

Hi, I'm Maya! I am a first-year Master's student at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. I am currently studying to get my M.S. in Biostatistics, with a concentration in Public Health Data Science. I graduated in May 2024 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (go Tar Heels!), with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S.P.H. in Biostatistics from the Gillings School of Global Public Health.

I also work at the Butler Aging Center at Columbia as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Aiello Research Group. Here, I aid in quantitative tasks and data analysis in SAS and R to prepare presentations and manuscripts related to the Add Health longitudinal study. I perform data audits and assist with quality control of data collection and reporting, as well.

## General Information

This website is for Homework 4 in P8105. In this homework, I will create a [dashboard](plots.html) that describe the distribution of data in [NYC Restaurant Inspections](https://p8105.com/dataset_restaurant_inspections.html). To see how this code was cleaned and how the visualizations were created with `plotly`, please visit [this](data_cleaning.html) page.


This will soon be used as my personal projects website.
