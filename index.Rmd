# This is Maya's awesome website

This is an **awesome website** about data science (and Elmo)?

Sometimes I use [google](https://www.google.com/) to do data science when I'm stuck.


There are two options for how to input an image stored on your device into a website:
`![](images/image.jpg)`  
`<img src="images/image.jpg" style="width:75%">`

If you'd like to learn more about this website, visit [this page](about.html).

Now I can put stuff on the internet!
