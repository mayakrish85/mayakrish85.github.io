## About Me

Hi! I'm Maya. I am a first-year Master's student at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. I am currently studying to get my M.S. in Biostatistics, with a concentration in Public Health Data Science. I graduated in May 2024 from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (go Tar Heels!), with a B.S. in Computer Science and a B.S.P.H. in Biostatistics from the Gillings School of Global Public Health.

I also work at the Butler Aging Center at Columbia as a Graduate Research Assistant in the Aiello Research Group. Here, I aid in quantitative tasks and data analysis in SAS and R to prepare presentations and manuscripts related to the Add Health longitudinal study. I also perform data audits and assist with quality control of data collection and reporting.
